    <p>Welcome to AddKitty - Malaysia's Premier Kitty Adoption Platform 

        At AddKitty, we believe every cat deserves a loving home. Our platform is dedicated to connecting compassionate individuals with cats in need, creating a seamless and trustworthy adoption process.  
        
        As advocates for animal welfare, we partner with local shelters, rescues, and independent caregivers across Malaysia to provide a wide variety of cats for adoption—ranging from playful kittens to senior companions. Whether you're looking for your first pet or adding to your family, we make finding your purr-fect match simple and stress-free.  
        
        Through education and support, we also guide new pet parents on responsible cat care, ensuring every adopted feline thrives in their new environment.  
        
        Start your adoption journey today and experience the joy of giving a furry friend a second chance at life. Together, we can make a difference—one paw at a time.
